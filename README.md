#### Background:
The rapid advancements in AI have enabled the development of intelligent chatbots that enhance user interaction on websites. Traditional chatbots are often limited to predefined responses, lacking the ability to dynamically interact with the web page content. This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a chatbot that not only leverages advanced AI capabilities but also dynamically accesses and interacts with the web page content, providing a more engaging and personalized user experience.

#### Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a chatbot that:
Integrates seamlessly into any website.
Utilizes a provided AI chatbot model API for intelligent responses.
Dynamically accesses and interprets web page content to answer user queries more effectively.
Enhances user engagement and support by providing contextually relevant information.

#### Methodologies:
To achieve these objectives, the project will employ the following methodologies and technologies:
AI Integration: Utilizing a pre-trained AI chatbot model through a provided API to handle natural language processing and generate responses.
Web Development: Implementing the chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure seamless embedding and interaction on websites.
Content Access: Developing mechanisms to allow the chatbot to access and interpret the content of the web page in real-time.
User Interface Design: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the chatbot.

#### Deliverables:
The project will deliver the following:
A fully functional chatbot that can be easily embedded into any website.
